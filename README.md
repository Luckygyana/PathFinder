# PathFinder

Learning something new is a daunting task, especially since it's not always clear where to start and what path to take. Pathfinder tackles this problem and personalizes your learning path.

Pathfinder creates a personalized roadmap for your educational needs and curates resources for you! Input a topic you want to master and any relevant knowledge you already have. Pathfinder will generate a path to mastery of the topic in the form of a visual flowchart of subtopics, where each subtopic has a curated list of resources from the internet.
